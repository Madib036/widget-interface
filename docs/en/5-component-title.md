# Title component

Use the Title component to display a piece of text

---

Title is a very basic small component, you can use Title to display article titles, table titles, or any piece of text.

## Implement the title of the table

First you can learn how to make a table in the Table explanation, now we need to add a title to the table, so that the reader can intuitively understand the theme of the table.

## Adjust the component order

Find the Title component from the component library in the Insert Tab, drag and drop it into the Canvas, the Title component is added to the bottom of the page by default, as the table title, we expect it to be above the table. You can drag and drop `title2` in the left panel UI tab, move it above `table1`, and the corresponding components in the Canvas will also be sorted in real time.

## Title

Select the Title component and switch to the Inspect Tab, the Inspect Tab shows the properties that the component can edit. The Text property is the content that Title displays, modify it to the content you want to display. To match the example, we modify it to: `Polkadot Network Extrinsic List`.
